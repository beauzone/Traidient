2.2 REST - News

## 2.2.1 Overview

Tiingo's news feeds are some of the most comprehensive news feeds available. We not only incorporate financial news sites, but also financial blogs - including those of small-time reputable bloggers, and tag them using the latest algos our team has been developing for over a decade. We bring these powerful feeds to you.

On a typical day, Tiingo adds over 8,000-12,000 articles a day.

You can find out about the full product offering on the [Product - News](https://www.tiingo.com/products/news-feed-api) page.
