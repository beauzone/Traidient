Thanks for sharing the API guide. The architecture looks solid and flexible, but you‚Äôre right to be thinking ahead ‚Äî a few of the features we‚Äôve brainstormed and implemented may need backend support or schema extensions to align fully with the deployment API. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of key alignment points and recommended updates to ask the AI coding platform to make:

‚úÖ What Already Aligns
Ticker, Entry Type, Strategy Name, and Risk Parameters
Everything we surface in the Strategy Assistant maps well to the deployment schema.

Entry logic with limit orders
Our strategy recommender already suggests ‚ÄúentryType: limit‚Äù and a price.

Risk management options (SL, TP, trailing stop)
All covered in the riskManagement object ‚Äî great fit.

‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Backend Enhancements
1. Custom Strategy Mapping or Dynamic Strategy ID Generation
We‚Äôre using human-readable strategy names like "Pullback Buy" in the frontend, but the deployment API requires a strategyId.

Ask the AI platform to:

Expose an endpoint or lookup utility:
GET /api/strategies/by-name?name=Pullback%20Buy
‚Üí returns { id: 8, name: 'Pullback Buy', parameters: {...} }

2. Support for AI-Generated Entry Commentary or Rationale (Optional)
We generate an AI rationale and backtest snippet. It‚Äôs not critical, but if we want to persist it:

Ask the AI platform to:

Add optional fields to botSettings or a related table:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  deploymentNotes?: string;
  backtestSnapshot?: {
    winRate: string;
    avgReturn: string;
  }
}
3. Better Support for Strategy Templates with Smart Defaults
Our frontend is assigning values like "moderate" for position size. That‚Äôs not supported in the current schema, which expects numbers.

Ask the AI platform to:

Add support for translating size profiles into numeric values:

ts
Copy
Edit
if positionSize.type === 'profile':
    resolve 'moderate' ‚Üí { type: 'percentage', value: 10 }
Or let us pass a string and have the API convert internally.

4. Bot Name Autogeneration (optional but nice)
We currently don‚Äôt ask users to name bots. You could:

Ask the AI platform to:

Allow the frontend to omit name, and generate something like:
‚ÄúAAPL Pullback Bot - Mar 2025‚Äù
based on symbol + strategy + date

‚úÖ Optional Enhancements We Could Use Later
Allow pre-deployment preview/validation (dry run)

Persist ‚Äúdeployed by AI strategy assistant‚Äù flag

Track recommendedBySystem: true in bot metadata

TL;DR ‚Äì What to Ask the AI Coding Platform To Do
Here‚Äôs a message you can send directly:

üí¨ Request to AI Platform:

We‚Äôve developed an AI-based Strategy Assistant that recommends trade strategies and risk setups. To integrate it with the POST /api/bots/deploy endpoint, we‚Äôd like to request the following additions:

Add a lookup endpoint to resolve strategyId from a strategy name.

Support passing positionSize.type: "profile" with values like "conservative", "moderate", or "aggressive" and convert them server-side.

Allow bots to be created without a name and auto-generate one.

Optionally support an aiRationale or deploymentNotes field in the botSettings schema.

Allow an optional backtest snapshot (e.g., { winRate, avgReturn }) to be stored with the bot.

Let us know if any of these are better implemented on the frontend.
