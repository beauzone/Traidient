OK. I asked another AI for ideas on how to approach this and this was their recommendation:

 Diagnosis: Why It’s Still Failing

Even though the WebSocket URL construction and fallback logic are improved, the key issue here seems to be:

❌ The frontend can’t connect to the backend due to Replit-hosted networking restrictions—likely triggered by Cloudflare’s bot protection or unsupported long-lived HTTP sessions.

This usually surfaces in two scenarios, even with polling:

1. Replit Autoscale Deployments

If your polling endpoint is hosted on a Replit autoscale deployment, Cloudflare may:
	•	Block frequent polling due to bot heuristics
	•	Issue 403/1020 or challenge pages (which fetch cannot solve)

2. Replit Webview or Extension iFrame context

If the frontend is inside an extension or Webview:
	•	Same-origin restrictions (CSP) may prevent requests to https://<repl>.repl.co
	•	Cloudflare might see the iframe origin as untrusted

✅ Recommended Fixes

🔁 1. Move Your Market Data Proxy Server to a Replit “Always-On” Workspace

Instead of deploying with autoscale:
	•	Run your data proxy server (polling handler) as a Replit workspace, not a deployed app.
	•	This bypasses Cloudflare’s autoscale + DDoS layer (which is enforced only in deployment mode).

You’ll still get a public URL like https://market-proxy.<your-repl>.repl.co, but Replit won’t route it through the Cloudflare ruleset.

✅ This has worked for similar use cases requiring tight-loop polling or SSE.

🌐 2. Use replit.dev Internal URLs (if both frontend & backend are in Replit)

If the frontend and backend are in the same Replit project (monorepo-style), you can use:
fetch('/api/market') // resolves to the same repl domain

This avoids issues with cross-origin requests and keeps everything internal.

 3. Add Lightweight CORS Headers and Short TTL Caching

Even if polling, always include:
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-store');

Cloudflare’s heuristics become more aggressive when cache headers or CORS are missing.
