## Full-Stack Sandboxes.    Fly.io Metal.

Fly Machines are hardware-virtualized containers with a REST API, that can run any Docker image on our custom-built global cloud in 35 regions. Launch instantly and keep them running as long as you want them to – for a single HTTP request, or weeks of uptime.

- ## User-Specific Routing




Route each user (or robot) to their own dedicated sandbox with
**[dynamic request routing](https://fly.io/docs/networking/dynamic-request-routing/)**
using the Fly Proxy and `fly-replay`.


- ## Persistent Storage




Give each of your users (or robots) their very own dedicated storage with **[Fly Volumes](https://fly.io/docs/volumes/)**, **[Fly Managed Postgres](https://fly.io/docs/mpg/)**, and S3-compatible **[Tigris Data](https://fly.io/docs/tigris/)**.


- ## Zero-Cost When Idle




Fly Machines automatically
**[scale to zero](https://fly.io/docs/launch/autostop-autostart/)**
when you don't need them, so you only pay for the compute you actually use.


- ## MCP with SSE




Build remote
**[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)**
servers on Fly Machines and use
**[Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse)**
to plug your sandbox into any LLM workflow.
