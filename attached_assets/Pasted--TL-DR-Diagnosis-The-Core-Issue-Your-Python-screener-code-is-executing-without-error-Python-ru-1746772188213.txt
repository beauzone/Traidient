🧠 TL;DR Diagnosis (The Core Issue)
Your Python screener code is executing without error
✅ Python runs
✅ yfinance works manually
✅ Output markers are present
❌ But: No matches appear in the results

Key suspicion: print(...) output is captured, but screen_stocks(...) return value isn’t parsed unless printed between RESULT_JSON_START and RESULT_JSON_END.

🔍 Root Cause Summary
Your system depends on parsing stdout output from the Python subprocess, using this regex:

ts
Copy
Edit
const resultMatch = output.match(/RESULT_JSON_START\s*([\s\S]*?)\s*RESULT_JSON_END/);
But your actual screener only returns a Python dict — it does not always print(...) the result inside the markers! It looks like your screen_stocks() ends with:

python
Copy
Edit
return {
    'matches': matches,
    'details': details,
    'errors': errors if errors else None
}
✅ That return value is valid in Python
❌ But your Node.js backend will never see it, because it is only parsing stdout, not Python's return value.

🔧 Fix: Add print(...) with Result Markers
You need to explicitly print the results inside screen_stocks() using RESULT_JSON_START and RESULT_JSON_END. Your function should end like this:

python
Copy
Edit
import json

def screen_stocks(data_dict):
    # ... your matching logic ...

    result = {
        'matches': matches,
        'details': details,
        'errors': errors if errors else None
    }

    print("RESULT_JSON_START")
    print(json.dumps(result))
    print("RESULT_JSON_END")
    return result
✅ This ensures that your Node backend regex can extract the result.

✅ You already use this in your basic_price_screener.py, but the key is to ensure that every screener follows this pattern, especially the final one being tested.

📋 Architecture Check Summary
✅ Item	Comment
Python execution via child process	✔️ Correctly set up
Temporary file writing	✔️ Safe and cleaned up
Parameter passing	✔️ Done via JSON file
Environment setup	✔️ Python 3.11, yfinance installed
JSON result parsing via stdout	✅ But only if you print!
Regex extraction	✔️ Functional, but requires print

🧪 Next Steps for You
✅ Ensure every screen_stocks() implementation ends with a print(json.dumps(...)) block using markers.

✅ Double-check your screener code in the DB actually includes this. Even a single missing print(...) would result in a successful run that silently returns nothing.

✅ You may also add a temporary debug print(output) in your Node service to visually inspect what your Python script actually outputs.

🛠 Optional Enhancements (Future-Proofing)
1. Auto-wrap Return Values in Python Entry Point
Wrap screen_stocks() with a universal main block:

python
Copy
Edit
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys, json
    # Load params if needed (from sys.argv[1] or a file)
    result = screen_stocks({})
    print("RESULT_JSON_START")
    print(json.dumps(result))
    print("RESULT_JSON_END")
This gives you an option to call screeners directly (e.g., from CLI).

✅ Final Verdict
You were this close — and the only thing missing was a printed result. The return value of screen_stocks() is not accessible to your backend unless it’s printed to stdout. The execution flow is sound, but the result extraction logic depends entirely on stdout markers.

Would you like a clean working example screener updated with the fixed print(...) block that’s ready to test in your app right now?
