### Key Dependencies
The application uses a JavaScript/TypeScript stack with:

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, wouter (routing)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **API Integrations**: Alpaca SDK, yahoo-finance2, OpenAI SDK, native API clients for Polygon.io and others
- **Backtesting**: Custom implementation with real market data
- **Visualization**: Recharts, Embla Carousel
- **WebSockets**: ws for realtime data streaming

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Tech Stack Summary

### Primary Technologies
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **State Management**: React Context + TanStack Query
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **API Requests**: Custom fetch wrappers with TanStack Query

### Integrations

#### Alpaca Trading API
- Implemented in `server/alpaca.ts`
- Features:
  - Account data retrieval
  - Position and order management
  - Historical market data for backtesting
  - Real-time data via WebSockets
  - Trading execution (market and limit orders)
  - Paper trading support

#### Yahoo Finance
- Implemented in `server/yahoo.ts`
- Used as a free data provider alternative
- Features:
  - Historical market data retrieval
  - Quote data
  - Symbol search
  - Market trend data (gainers, losers, sector performance)

#### Polygon.io
- Implemented in `server/polygon.ts`
- Features:
  - Real-time and historical market data
  - Quote information
  - Market status checking

#### OpenAI Integration
- Implemented in `server/openai.ts`
- Features:
  - AI-powered strategy generation based on user prompts
  - Strategy optimization based on backtest results
  - Strategy explanation in natural language

#### Other Integrations
- **Tiingo API** (`server/tiingo.ts`): Alternative market data provider
- **Alpha Vantage** (`server/alphavantage.ts`): Additional market data source

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Key Functional Components

### Market Data Retrieval
- **Historical Data**: 
  - Implemented in `server/marketDataProviders.ts` with provider-specific integrations
  - Factory pattern to create appropriate provider based on user selection
  - Normalization of data formats across providers
  - Timeframe conversion logic for each provider

- **Real-time Data**: 
  - Implemented in `server/marketDataService.ts` and delivered via WebSockets
  - Connection management in `server/routes.ts`
  - Client-side hooks in `client/src/hooks/useMarketData.ts`

### Screening and Filtering Logic
- Currently implemented as part of strategy configuration
- Assets are defined in strategy configuration object
- No dedicated screening service; filtering handled within strategy implementation

### Signal Generation
- Implemented within strategy code
- Strategies can define custom indicators and parameters
- Strategy source code can be viewed/edited in the editor
- AI-powered strategies can use various technical indicators defined in parameters

### Order Execution Logic
- Implemented in `server/routes.ts` for API endpoints
- Trade execution handled by Alpaca API
- Order types include market and limit orders
- Deployment service connects strategies to live trading

### Portfolio Management Logic
- Position sizing defined in strategy configuration
- Risk controls include max position size, stop loss, and take profit settings
- Cash allocation based on strategy parameters
- Portfolio visualization in dashboard view

### Account Monitoring / Reporting
- Real-time position and order monitoring in live trading view
- Performance metrics calculated in backtest results
- Positions table with unrealized P&L
- Asset allocation visualization on dashboard

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Current Architecture & Design Patterns

### Overall Architecture
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Clear separation between frontend and backend
- **RESTful API Design**: Structured around resources with standard HTTP methods
- **WebSocket for Real-time Data**: Event-driven architecture for market data updates
- **Provider Pattern**: Multiple interchangeable data sources
- **Repository Pattern**: Database access abstracted through storage interface

### Core Logic Organization
- **Service-Based Organization**: Backend organized into logical services (market data, backtesting, etc.)
- **Interface-Driven Design**: Common interfaces for interchangeable components (MarketDataProvider)
- **Factory Pattern**: Provider creation via factory functions
- **Context Providers**: React contexts for shared state management

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Trading strategies encapsulated with standard interfaces
- **Factory Pattern**: For market data provider creation
- **Provider Pattern**: For API integrations
- **Repository Pattern**: Through the storage interface
- **Observer Pattern**: WebSocket implementation for market data updates
- **Adapter Pattern**: Normalizing data formats across different providers

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Identified Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths
- **Provider Abstraction**: Well-designed provider interfaces allow easy switching between data sources
- **Modern Frontend**: Clean React components with proper state management
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript implementation
- **Database Schema**: Well-structured schema with proper relations
- **API Integration**: Clean separation of API clients with consistent interfaces
- **AI Integration**: Innovative use of OpenAI for strategy generation and optimization
- **Multi-account Support**: Ability to manage multiple trading accounts
- **Visualization**: Comprehensive charting and visualization components

### Weaknesses
- **Strategy Source Handling**: Some issues with strategy source code management
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across API integrations
- **Market Hours Logic**: Some duplication in market hours detection logic
- **Historical Data Limitations**: Some symbols cause issues with certain providers
- **Real Strategy Implementation**: Strategy execution could be more sophisticated
- **Performance Monitoring**: Limited tools for monitoring strategy performance over time
- **Backtesting Speed**: Backtesting can be slow for large datasets or complex strategies
- **Testing Coverage**: Limited automated testing visible in the codebase

The application has a solid foundation with well-structured components, but could benefit from improvements in error handling, testing, and some structural enhancements for strategy execution.
