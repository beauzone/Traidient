# Stock Screener Bug Analysis and Fixes

After analyzing the Python screener execution issues, I've identified the following problems:

1. **Syntax Error in Python Execution**: When the screener is executed by the server, the execution environment seems to be loading additional code that contains syntax errors. Specifically, there's an `elif` statement outside of a proper if-else structure at line 807 in the generated Python file.

2. **String Formatting Issues**: The f-strings with dictionary access like `f"{symbol}: Price=${details["price"]}"` are causing syntax errors in the execution environment.

3. **Python Environment Setup**: There may be issues with how the Python environment is set up, as some import errors are appearing.

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Fix the Basic Screener Template**:
   - Use the simple `.format()` string formatting method instead of f-strings
   - Ensure all code has proper structure without syntax errors
   - Remove any complex dependencies like scipy.signal that might not be available

2. **Fix the Python Execution Service**:
   - The service appears to be injecting additional code that's causing problems
   - Modify the template generation to avoid injecting code with syntax errors
   - Implement better error handling to trace the exact failures

3. **Create a Minimal Working Example**:
   - Start with an extremely simple screener that just returns fixed data
   - Gradually add features once we have a working base
   - Test each feature carefully before moving to the next one

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create a simplified screener**:
   ```python
   import json
   import sys
   from datetime import datetime
   
   def main():
       try:
           # Simple output with fixed data for testing
           results = {
               "success": True,
               "matches": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOG"],
               "details": {
                   "AAPL": {"price": 180.0, "sma20": 175.0, "rsi": 55.0},
                   "MSFT": {"price": 360.0, "sma20": 350.0, "rsi": 60.0},
                   "GOOG": {"price": 140.0, "sma20": 135.0, "rsi": 58.0}
               },
               "count": 3,
               "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
           }
           
           print(json.dumps(results))
           return 0
       except Exception as e:
           error_message = "Error in screener: {}".format(str(e))
           print(json.dumps({
               "success": False,
               "error": error_message,
               "matches": [],
               "details": {},
               "count": 0,
               "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
           }))
           return 1

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       sys.exit(main())
   ```

2. **Once that works, expand to include real data processing**:
   ```python
   import json
   import sys
   from datetime import datetime
   import yfinance as yf
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   
   def get_stock_data(symbols):
       data = {}
       for symbol in symbols[:5]:  # Limit to 5 for testing
           try:
               stock = yf.Ticker(symbol)
               df = stock.history(period="1mo")
               if not df.empty:
                   data[symbol] = df
           except Exception as e:
               print("Error getting data for {}: {}".format(symbol, e))
       return data
   
   def main():
       # [rest of implementation]
   ```

3. **Finally, add the full screening logic when basic data fetching works**

This approach will help identify the exact issues and allow us to build a reliable screener step by step.
