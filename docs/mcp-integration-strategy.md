# MCP Integration Strategy - Meeting Notes

## Context
Discussion about Alpaca's newly released Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and its implications for our AI-powered trading platform.

**Date**: June 4, 2025  
**Repository**: https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-mcp-server

## Key Discovery

Alpaca has officially released an MCP server that provides:
- Direct integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
- Comprehensive trading functionality (stocks, options, portfolio management)
- Real-time market data access
- Watchlist management
- Account and position management
- Natural language trading commands

## Strategic Vision

### MCP as Industry Standard
- MCP is gaining traction and becoming an industry standard (similar to OpenAI API adoption)
- Expectation that major financial services will adopt MCP protocol
- SnapTrade potentially supporting MCP in the future would provide access to multiple brokerages via common protocol

### Vendor-Agnostic Architecture
**Core Principle**: Develop features and architecture in an abstracted, vendor-agnostic way
- Swap out backend services (data providers, brokerages) with no UI changes
- Minimal codebase changes when switching providers
- Alpaca is current MVP brokerage, not permanent solution

### Implementation Strategy
- **Start implementing MCP** - it's the future protocol standard
- **Avoid vendor-specific features** that can't be abstracted
- **Design for multiple providers** from the beginning

## New Functionality Possibilities

### Enhanced AI Trading Assistants
- Direct natural language trading through Claude/AI models
- Voice-activated trading commands
- Conversational portfolio management
- AI-powered trade explanations and insights

### Advanced Options Trading Capabilities
- Multi-leg options strategies (bull spreads, iron condors, etc.)
- Real-time options Greeks analysis
- Options chain visualization with AI insights
- Complex strategy recommendations based on market conditions

### Intelligent Market Analysis
- AI-powered corporate announcements analysis
- Earnings calendar integration with strategy suggestions
- Market sentiment analysis from multiple data sources
- Automated dividend tracking and reinvestment strategies

### Enhanced User Experience
- Natural language queries for all trading functions
- Conversational onboarding for new traders
- AI-powered trade explanations and education
- Voice-controlled portfolio monitoring

## Integration Approaches

### Option A: Direct Integration
- Embed Alpaca's MCP server as a microservice
- Route specific trading commands through their proven system
- Maintain our UI while leveraging their trading engine

### Option B: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Use our current system for screeners, strategies, and analytics
- Leverage their MCP for actual trade execution and real-time data
- Best of both worlds - our intelligence, their execution

### Option C: MCP Standard Adoption
- Refactor our platform to support MCP protocol
- Enable integration with multiple AI models and tools
- Future-proof our architecture for the MCP ecosystem

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: MCP Abstraction Layer
1. **Create MCP Abstraction Layer**
   - Define our own internal trading interfaces
   - Map MCP protocol calls to our standardized methods
   - Ensure all vendor-specific details are isolated

2. **Gradual Migration Approach**
   - Keep existing Alpaca integration as fallback
   - Implement MCP alongside current system
   - Gradually shift functionality once proven stable

3. **Future-Ready Architecture**
   - Design for multiple concurrent MCP servers
   - Support user choice of preferred brokerage
   - Enable feature parity checking across providers

### Strategic Advantages
1. **Proven Trading Infrastructure** - Alpaca's battle-tested execution system
2. **AI-First Design** - Built specifically for LLM interactions
3. **Rapid Development** - Leverage their work instead of rebuilding
4. **Enhanced Credibility** - Partnership with established broker
5. **Future-Proof** - Ready for SnapTrade and other MCP adoptions

## Key Alpaca MCP Features

### Account & Trading
- `get_account_info()` - View balance, margin, and account status
- `get_positions()` - List all held assets
- `place_stock_order()` - Market, limit, stop orders with advanced options
- `close_position()` - Close partial or full positions
- Options trading with multi-leg strategies

### Market Data
- Real-time quotes and historical data
- Options Greeks and contract analysis
- Corporate announcements and earnings
- Market calendar and trading sessions

### Management
- Watchlist creation and management
- Order history and cancellation
- Asset search and metadata

## Next Steps

The architecture should position us perfectly for when SnapTrade and other major players adopt MCP. We'll be ready to plug them in seamlessly while maintaining our competitive differentiation through superior AI-powered analysis and user experience.

Focus areas for implementation:
1. Design the abstraction layer architecture
2. Implement MCP integration alongside existing systems
3. Ensure vendor-agnostic feature development
4. Prepare for multi-provider support

## Conclusion

MCP adoption is strategic and necessary for future competitiveness. The key is implementing it in a way that maintains our vendor-agnostic architecture while leveraging the benefits of this emerging standard protocol.
