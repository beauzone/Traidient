1. **Follow the Required Structure**: Each component type (strategy, screener, etc.) has specific structural requirements.

2. **Use the Proper Output Format**: Ensure your components return data in the expected format.

3. **Respect Performance Constraints**: Optimize your code for efficiency.

4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement proper error handling to prevent crashes.

5. **Follow Best Practices**: Each guide includes best practices specific to that component type.
